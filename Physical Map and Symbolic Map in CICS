** Physical Map and Symbolic Map in CICS **

In CICS (Customer Information Control System), physical maps and symbolic maps are both used in BMS (Basic Mapping Support) to define screen layouts, but they serve different purposes:

**Physical Map**

-> It is a load module generated by a BMS map assembler and stored in the CICS system dataset.
-> It defines the screen's layout, including fields, positions, and attributes.
-> CICS uses it to send formatted data to the terminal.
-> It contains hardcoded screen attributes like color, intensity, and field positions.

** Symbolic Map**

-> It is a copybook (COBOL and PL/I ) used in the application program.
-> It provides data structures (field names and lengths) that correspond to the fields on the physical map.
-> It is used by the program to send and receive data to/from the screen.
-> It makes it easier to access and manipulate screen fields programmatically.


Physical Map: Defines the screen layout and how data is displayed.
Symbolic Map: Used by the application program to reference input and output fields.
